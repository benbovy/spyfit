Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `spyfit` for local development.

1. Fork the `spyfit` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/spyfit.git

3. Install your local copy (you might consider creating first a new virtual
   environment using either conda or virtualenv)::

    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
