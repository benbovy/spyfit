**This package is currently under heavy development!
It hasn't been released yet.**

**sfit4py** is a user-friendly interface to the SFIT4_ retrieval software.

It provides command-line utilities, a Python API and a collection of
helpful functions, which all aim to allow easier I/O handling, full automation
and management of SFIT4 runs.

Why sfit4py?
------------

There are already Python codes related to SFIT4, e.g., those
written by Eric Nussbaumer (the SFIT4 Layer0 and Layer1), Mathias Palm
and Bavo Langerock.
**sfit4py** takes ideas from those codes and has features in common.
Additionaly, it tries to follow as much as possible the good practices
in the Python scientific ecosystem (e.g., readability, reproducibility,
using standard formats, PEP8 style guide / numpy docstrings, packaging...).
It aims to provide helpful tools and solutions to SFIT4 users while letting
them choosing how they want to organize their retrieval runs.

Main Features
-------------

- SFIT4 I/O import, export and storage using the `Common Data Model`_
  and netCDF_ files. The xray_ package - a required dependency - implements
  this data model and provides a powerful framework for easy inspection,
  merging and processing of retrieval data generated by SFIT4.
- More readable, "pythonic" names for parameters and variables (also follow
  the `CF`_ standard names when possible). Possibility to revert to the names
  defined in the SFIT4 core code or in the `sfit4.ctl` file.
- Calculation of retrieval error budgets.
- Retrieval data export using the GEOMS_ compliant HDF4 format.
- Full-automation of SFIT4 runs. Archiving and management using a
  sqlite database.
- Highly configurable and modular.
