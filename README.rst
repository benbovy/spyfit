**This package is currently under heavy development!
It hasn't been released yet.**

**sfit4py** is a user-friendly interface to the SFIT4_ retrieval software.

It provides command-line utilities and a Python API, which both aim to allow
easy I/O handling, full automation and management of SFIT4 runs.

Main Features
-------------

- SFIT4 I/O import, export and storage using the netCDF_ data model.

  model and provides a powerful framework for easy inspection, merging and
  processing of retrieval data generated by SFIT4.
- Calculation of retrieval error budgets.
- Retrieval data export using the GEOMS_ compliant HDF4 format.
- Full-automation of SFIT4 runs and management using a sqlite database.
- Highly configurable.
